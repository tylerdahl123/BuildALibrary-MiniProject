# Build-A-Library
## Description
 ---
 
 for this project I am using inheritence and classes to create a library organization tool. The basic idea and starting code for this project is from codecademy.
## Install 
---

 To run solely within your code editor you will need node installed and just run node. If you do not have node installed you can simply use the inspect tool on your web browser to see the magic.

 Libraries are filled with lots of information that is slightly similar yet also differnt. this program allows one to make sub classes while using one main class.
